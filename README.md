# GitHub Topic Explorer

## Assignment:

Your task is to build a React web application that displays all the "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#topic)" related to the term "react", using the GitHub GraphQL API.

The application should display how many "[stargazers](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#stargazerconnection)" each topic has. A click on a topic should display the topics related to that topic, and how many stargazers they have. And so forth. There should also be Search capability to search/query on any term or topic.Â You should implement best practices with the UI.

To interact with the Github GraphQL API you'll need to have

- a [Github API key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql)
- You'll want to make use of the key in the .env file within your application

You may use whatever React framework or library you find useful. URL routing is optional.

## Evaluation:

- We will pay particular attention to the way the code is organized, and to the overall readability
- Unit tests will be greatly appreciated
- Design will be ignored, however usability and accessibility will be taken into consideration
- Remember to update this README with instructions on how to install, run and test your application
- Your first goal is to have a working app, but feel free to improve the application however you see fit
- We hope that you can complete the assignment within 2 hours but don't set any time constraints
- Please reach out per email or by opening an issue if anything is unclear or blocking you

Best of luck

## Dev Notes

- Leave any technical notes on any libraries or tools you chose to use, the more detail the better.

### How to run app & test

    - Run code editor
    - Type in terminal: "git clone https://github.com/seriksk1/git-topic-explorer.git ."
    - Type in terminal: "npm i"
    - To run the app you have to create a github token here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
    - Create .env file and create a variable: "REACT_APP_GITHUB_API_TOKEN={Token}" (You can check .env.template file as example)
    - Start the app by command "npm run start"
